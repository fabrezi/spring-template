# Spring-boot Notes

Spring-boot is a framework to built Java based web applications.

### Configuration

1. Use spring initialzer (https://start.spring.io/) to get the intial setup of the project.
2. fix the source root, java jdk setup and set the pom.xml to maven project.
3. invalidate cache and restart the project.

## Annotations

The ones that I find of application are `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`
and other similar kinds.
